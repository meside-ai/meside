server: This is a Bun-based Hono API server that uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.

Key features and components:
- Framework: Hono.js for API routes with middleware
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for schema management
- Auth: Custom JWT-based authentication system
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for observability
- APIs: Auth, Thread, LLM, Chat
- Structure:
  - /api/: API route handlers
  - /db/: Database connection and schema definitions
  - /service/: Business logic and service implementations
  - /middleware/: Reusable middleware (authentication, etc.)
  - /utils/: Utility functions
  - /configs/: Configuration and environment variables
  - /mappers/: Convert ORM Entity to Dtos for API expose
  - @meside/shared/api/: the API definition between server api and front-end

Development workflow:
- Run dev server: `bun run dev`

When working with this codebase:
1. Before writing any files, learn same file in the same directory.
2. Throw new HttpError, dont return c.json({ error })
4. Follow the API pattern: route definition in @meside/shared/api/, controller logic in /api/ and business logic in /service/
4. Use Zod for DB validation and type-safety
